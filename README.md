## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

   ```

## Running the Project

### Development Mode

To start the project in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:

- Set `NODE_ENV` to `development`.
- Use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server on code changes.

### Build

To build the frontend and install necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:

- Install backend dependencies.
- Install frontend dependencies and build the frontend project.

### Production Mode

To start the project in production mode:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will:

- Set `NODE_ENV` to `production`.
- Run the backend server.

## File Structure

- `frontend/` - Contains the frontend source code and build configuration.
- `backend/` - Contains the backend source code and configuration.
- `package.json` - Contains project metadata and scripts.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URL=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
```

Replace `<your-mongodb-connection-string>` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

## Common Issues

- **ENOENT Error:** If you encounter an `ENOENT` error, ensure the `frontend/dist` directory exists and contains the `index.html` file. Adjust paths in `backend/server.js` if necessary.

- **Module Not Found:** Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly by running `npm install` in the root directory.

## Deployment

For deployment, ensure the `frontend/dist` directory is correctly included and accessible by the backend server. Adjust paths in `backend/server.js` as needed based on your deployment environment.
